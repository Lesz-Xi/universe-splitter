# universe-splitter

Universe Splitter is a playful web app inspired by the concept of parallel universes. It lets you input two different scenarios, thoughts, or actions you’re considering. The app then randomly chooses between them, helping you “split the universe” and decide which path to take.
How It Works 1. Enter Two Scenarios:
• In the first box, type what you would do in one universe.
• In the second box, type what you would do in the other universe. 2. Split the Universe:
• Click the SPLIT THE UNIVERSE button.
• The app will randomly select one of your inputs and display:
• `In one Universe, I will now: your input`
• `Other Universe, I will now: your other input`
Features
• Simple and Fun: Decide between two choices with a cosmic twist.
• Randomization: The app randomly picks between your two scenarios.
• Stylish Space Theme: Enjoy an engaging, animated space background with planets, stars, and an astronaut.
